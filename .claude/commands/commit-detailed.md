description: "Analyze git changes and generate a detailed commit message following project conventions"
argument-hint: "[optional: specific focus area]"
---

Analyze the current git changes and create a comprehensive commit message following the project's existing conventions.

First, let me analyze the project's commit history to understand the conventions:

!git log --oneline -30

Now, let me gather all the git change information:

!git status --porcelain

!git diff --cached --stat

!git diff --cached

!git diff --stat

!git diff

Based on the commit history and changes above, I will now:

## 1. Change Analysis
First, let me analyze the full scope of changes from git status output:

Example analysis of git status --porcelain:
```
M  file1.js         ‚Üí 1 modified file
?? new-file.ts      ‚Üí 1 new file
?? another-new.md   ‚Üí 1 new file
D  deleted.css      ‚Üí 1 deleted file
```
Result: 4 total files changed (1 modified, 2 added, 1 deleted)

- **Modified files (M)**: Count files with M prefix
- **New files (??)**: Count files with ?? prefix  
- **Deleted files (D)**: Count files with D prefix
- **Renamed files (R)**: Count files with R prefix
- **Total changes**: Sum of all file changes

## 2. Language Detection
Analyze the language used in recent commits (last 30 commits):
- If mostly English ‚Üí use English
- If mostly Korean ‚Üí use Korean  
- If mixed ‚Üí follow the most recent pattern
- If another language ‚Üí use that language

## 3. Convention Pattern Detection
Identify the commit message pattern from history:
- **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): description` or `type: description`
  - Common types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
- **Gitmoji**: Using emojis like üé®, üêõ, ‚ú®, üìù, etc.
- **Angular**: Similar to conventional but with specific scopes
- **Simple**: Just descriptive messages without prefixes
- **Custom**: Project-specific patterns

## 4. Commit Message Generation

Create an effective commit message that balances detail with readability:
1. **Follows the detected language** from the project history
2. **Uses the identified convention pattern**
3. **Maintains consistency** with recent commits
4. **Provides essential context** without overwhelming detail

### Analysis Results:
Looking at the recent commits and current changes, I can see:
- **Primary Language**: [Detected from commit history]
- **Convention Used**: [Detected pattern]
- **Common Prefixes/Types**: [List of used types]
- **Files Changed**: [Total number from git status analysis]
  - Modified: [X files]
  - Added: [Y files]
  - Deleted: [Z files]
- **Change Complexity**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex based on total file count]

### Adaptive Commit Message Strategy:

I'll determine the appropriate level of detail based on:
- Total number of files changed (including new, modified, deleted)
- Complexity of changes
- Presence of breaking changes
- Architectural impact

#### For SIMPLE changes (1-2 total files, straightforward fixes):
```
[type]: [concise description]

- Fixed [specific issue]
- Updated [component] to [handle case]
```

#### For MODERATE changes (3-10 total files, feature additions):
```
[type]: [clear summary of change]

Context:
[1-2 sentences: why this change was needed]

Changes:
- [Main change 1 and its purpose]
- [Main change 2 and its purpose]
- [Any important side effects]

Testing: [How it was tested]
```

#### For COMPLEX changes (10+ total files, architectural changes, breaking changes):
```
[type]: [comprehensive summary]

## Why
[2-3 sentences: Problem being solved, previous limitations]

## What Changed
[3-5 bullet points: Key modifications and approach]

## Impact
[Only if breaking changes or migration needed]

## Key Files
- [critical_file.js]: [Core logic change]
- [config.json]: [New configuration added]
[List only files with significant changes]

## Testing
[Test approach and coverage]

Refs: #[issue] [related PRs]
```

### Essential Context Guidelines:

**ALWAYS Include:**
- **Why**: The problem or requirement (1-2 sentences)
- **What**: Key changes made (bullet points)
- **Risk**: Breaking changes or security impacts (if any)

**Include When Relevant:**
- **How**: Technical approach (only for complex logic)
- **Testing**: Test coverage (for critical changes)
- **References**: Related issues/PRs

**AVOID:**
- Redundant file lists (git already shows this)
- Obvious changes ("updated version number")
- Implementation details that are clear from code
- Boilerplate text that adds no value

### Generated Commit Message:

Based on the comprehensive analysis of all changes:
- Total files affected: [X] (Modified: [A], Added: [B], Deleted: [C])
- Lines changed: [Y insertions, Z deletions]
- Complexity level: [Simple/Moderate/Complex]

```
[Title: Clear, actionable summary reflecting ALL changes]

[Context - Why This Change]
Brief explanation of the problem or need that prompted this change.
Focus on the "why" rather than the "what" (code shows what).

[Key Changes]
‚Ä¢ Main modification and its purpose
‚Ä¢ New additions and their role
‚Ä¢ Any important side effects or considerations

[Impact - Only if needed]
Breaking: [describe if applicable]
Migration: [steps if required]
Performance: [impact if significant]

[Testing - For non-trivial changes]
Tested: [approach used]

[References - If applicable]
Issue: #XXX
Related: #XXX
```

### Real Examples:

**Simple Fix:**
```
fix: Correct null pointer exception in user authentication

- Added null check before accessing user.email
- Returns early with proper error message
```

**Feature Addition:**
```
feat: Add dark mode support to dashboard

Context:
Users requested dark mode for better visibility in low-light environments.

Changes:
‚Ä¢ Implemented theme context provider with localStorage persistence
‚Ä¢ Added CSS variables for dynamic color switching
‚Ä¢ Updated all dashboard components to use theme-aware colors

Testing: Manual testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
```

**Complex Refactor:**
```
refactor: Migrate authentication to JWT-based system

## Why
Session-based auth was causing scaling issues with multiple servers.
JWT enables stateless authentication and better microservice support.

## What Changed
‚Ä¢ Replaced session store with JWT token generation
‚Ä¢ Updated middleware to validate JWT instead of sessions
‚Ä¢ Added refresh token mechanism for security
‚Ä¢ Modified user model to store refresh tokens

## Breaking Changes
- API now requires Bearer token instead of cookie
- Logout endpoint changed from DELETE to POST

## Migration
1. Update client to store JWT in localStorage
2. Implement token refresh logic
3. Update API calls to include Authorization header

Tested: Unit tests + integration tests + staging deployment
Refs: #1234, RFC-007
```

$ARGUMENTS

Note: If you specified a focus area, I've emphasized those aspects in the commit message above.

## 5. Contextual Analysis

Before finalizing the commit message, ensure you've considered:
- All new files (?? prefix) - these often represent new features or components
- Modified files (M prefix) - understand the nature of modifications
- The relationship between new and modified files
- Whether new files are related to modifications in existing files

## 6. Execute Commit

Now I'll create the commit with the generated message that reflects ALL changes:

!git add -A

!git commit -m "[Insert the generated commit title here]" -m "[Insert the body and footer if needed]"

The commit has been created successfully. You can verify with:

!git log --oneline -1
