# Agent Spec Process

## Purpose
Ensure every agent specification is authored and reviewed in strict alignment with the shared templates.

## Author Checklist
- Read `docs/templates/spec-writing-guide.md` before drafting.
- Structure the document according to the sections defined in that guide.
- Confirm the spec satisfies every author checklist item from the guide prior to review.

## Reviewer Checklist
- Review with `docs/templates/spec-review-guide.md` open and check off each requirement.
- Block approval until the spec demonstrably follows both the author and reviewer guides.
- Document any deviations in review comments and request updates before sign-off.

## Submission Flow
1. Draft the specification while mirroring the writing guide.
2. Perform a self-review using the writing guide checklist and note completion in the PR description.
3. Request review; reviewers evaluate exclusively via the review guide and only approve when all items pass.
